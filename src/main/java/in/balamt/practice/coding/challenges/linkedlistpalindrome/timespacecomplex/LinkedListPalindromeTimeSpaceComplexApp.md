The provided implementation does not achieve the desired time complexity of \( O(n) \) and space complexity of \( O(1) \) because:

1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the `isPalindrome` method is \( O(n^2) \) because of the following reasons:
    - Reversing the second half of the linked list involves removing and adding elements, which has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).
    - Comparing the elements of the first half with the reversed second half also has a time complexity of \( O(n) \).

   Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also not \( O(1) \) because the provided implementation modifies the input linked list in-place but still uses extra space for the reversed second half of the list. The additional space required is proportional to the size of the list's second half, so the space complexity is \( O(n/2) = O(n) \), where \( n \) is the size of the linked list.

To achieve the desired time complexity of \( O(n) \) and space complexity of \( O(1) \), you would need to modify the algorithm. One common approach is to reverse the first half of the linked list in place, and then compare the reversed first half with the second half of the list. This approach requires only constant extra space and achieves the desired time complexity. Let me provide you with an updated implementation:

```java
public class PalindromeLinkedList {

    // Method to reverse the linked list
    private static ListNode reverse(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextTemp = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextTemp;
        }
        return prev;
    }

    // Method to check if a linked list is palindrome
    public static boolean isPalindrome(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return true; // Empty or single-node list is palindrome
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        while (fast.next != null && fast.next.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        ListNode firstHalf = head;
        ListNode secondHalf = reverse(slow.next);
        slow.next = null;

        while (firstHalf != null && secondHalf != null) {
            if (firstHalf.val != secondHalf.val) {
                return false;
            }
            firstHalf = firstHalf.next;
            secondHalf = secondHalf.next;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example 1: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1] => palindrome
        ListNode list1 = new ListNode(1);
        list1.next = new ListNode(2);
        list1.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        list1.next.next.next = new ListNode(2);
        list1.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(1);
        System.out.println("Is list1 palindrome? " + isPalindrome(list1));

        // Example 2: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] => not palindrome
        ListNode list2 = new ListNode(1);
        list2.next = new ListNode(2);
        list2.next.next = new ListNode(3);
        list2.next.next.next = new ListNode(4);
        list2.next.next.next.next = new ListNode(5);
        System.out.println("Is list2 palindrome? " + isPalindrome(list2));
    }
}

class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;

    ListNode(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }
}
```

In this updated implementation, the `isPalindrome` method achieves a time complexity of \( O(n) \) and a space complexity of \( O(1) \), where \( n \) is the size of the linked list.
