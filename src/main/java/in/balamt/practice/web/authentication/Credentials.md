#Credentials

Online user authentications, Username and Password are called Credentials.

##Username
* Username should be unique in any system/application.
* Certain times' username is a suitable username
* Unique, memorable and not burdensome

##Password
* Use html input with the type "password"
```html
<input type="password" name="user_password" />
``` 
  * Replaces input during text entered with big dots.

##Best practices 
1. Do not allow user or javascripts to paste values into username and password fields.
2. Avoid putting background images on username and password fields.
3. Configure HTTPs for secure communication (Encrypted channel)
4. Mindful of account enumeration (Trial and error in entering username and password multiple times - Brute force attack)
