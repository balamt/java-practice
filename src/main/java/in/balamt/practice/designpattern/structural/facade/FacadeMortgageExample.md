In a mortgage application scenario, a Facade pattern can be used to encapsulate the complexity of various subsystems involved in the mortgage approval process. Let's consider a simplified example where the mortgage approval process involves multiple steps such as credit check, income verification, and property appraisal.

```java
// Subsystem classes
class CreditCheck {
    public boolean checkCreditScore(String applicantName) {
        // Simulated credit check logic
        System.out.println("CreditCheck: Performing credit check for " + applicantName);
        return Math.random() > 0.5; // Random result for demonstration
    }
}

class IncomeVerification {
    public boolean verifyIncome(String applicantName) {
        // Simulated income verification logic
        System.out.println("IncomeVerification: Verifying income for " + applicantName);
        return Math.random() > 0.5; // Random result for demonstration
    }
}

class PropertyAppraisal {
    public double appraiseProperty(String propertyAddress) {
        // Simulated property appraisal logic
        System.out.println("PropertyAppraisal: Appraising property at " + propertyAddress);
        return Math.random() * 1000000; // Random appraisal value for demonstration
    }
}

// Facade class
class MortgageApprovalFacade {
    private CreditCheck creditCheck;
    private IncomeVerification incomeVerification;
    private PropertyAppraisal propertyAppraisal;

    public MortgageApprovalFacade() {
        this.creditCheck = new CreditCheck();
        this.incomeVerification = new IncomeVerification();
        this.propertyAppraisal = new PropertyAppraisal();
    }

    public boolean approveMortgage(String applicantName, String propertyAddress) {
        System.out.println("MortgageApprovalFacade: Processing mortgage approval for " + applicantName);
        boolean creditCheckPassed = creditCheck.checkCreditScore(applicantName);
        boolean incomeVerificationPassed = incomeVerification.verifyIncome(applicantName);
        double propertyValue = propertyAppraisal.appraiseProperty(propertyAddress);

        // Simplified logic for demonstration
        if (creditCheckPassed && incomeVerificationPassed && propertyValue > 0) {
            System.out.println("MortgageApprovalFacade: Mortgage approved for " + applicantName);
            return true;
        } else {
            System.out.println("MortgageApprovalFacade: Mortgage rejected for " + applicantName);
            return false;
        }
    }
}

// Client
public class Client {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MortgageApprovalFacade facade = new MortgageApprovalFacade();
        String applicantName = "John Doe";
        String propertyAddress = "123 Main St";

        // Client invokes the facade to apply for a mortgage
        boolean approved = facade.approveMortgage(applicantName, propertyAddress);
        System.out.println("Mortgage approval status: " + (approved ? "Approved" : "Rejected"));
    }
}
```

In this example:

- The `CreditCheck`, `IncomeVerification`, and `PropertyAppraisal` classes represent the subsystems responsible for performing credit checks, income verification, and property appraisal, respectively.
- The `MortgageApprovalFacade` encapsulates the complexity of coordinating interactions with the subsystems. It provides a simple `approveMortgage` method that clients can invoke to apply for a mortgage.
- The `Client` class demonstrates how a client can use the `MortgageApprovalFacade` to apply for a mortgage without needing to understand the intricacies of the individual subsystems.

By using the Facade pattern, the mortgage approval process is simplified for clients, and the details of the underlying subsystems are hidden, promoting better maintainability and ease of use.
