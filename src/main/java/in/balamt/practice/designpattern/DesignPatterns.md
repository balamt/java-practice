# Design Patterns

Design patterns are well-proved solution for solving specific task/problem. Design patterns are not programming 
language specific it is independent strategies for solving the common design problems,
that means design pattern represents an idea, not a particular implementation. 

By using design patterns we can make code more flexible, reusable and  maintainable.
it is the most important part because 
**java** uses it internally.

## Advantages of Design Patterns:

1. They are reusable in multiple projects
2. They provide the solutions that help to define the system architecture.
3. They capture the software engineering experiences.
4. They provide transparency to the design of an application.
5. They are well-proven and testified solutions since they have been build upon the knowledge and experience of expert 
software developers.
6. Design patterns don't guarantee an absolute solution to a problem. They provide clarity to the system architecture 
and the possibility of building a better system.


## When to use design patters?
 During analysis and requirement phase of SDLC (Software development life cycle) the design pattern is used.

-----------------------------------------------------------
## Types of design patterns:
In Core Java we have 3 types of design patterns.

###Type of Design Pattern in Java:
1. Creational design pattern
2. Structural design pattern
3. Behavioral design pattern

##Creational design pattern:

Creational design pattern are concentrated in the way by which objects are created. They reduce complexities 
and instability
