To implement an adaptive circuit breaker in a Spring Boot application, you can use the Resilience4j library, which provides comprehensive support for implementing circuit breakers and other resilience patterns. Below is an example of a Spring Boot application using Resilience4j for an adaptive circuit breaker:

First, add the Resilience4j dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version> <!-- Replace with the latest version -->
</dependency>
```

Now, create a service that includes a method with the adaptive circuit breaker annotation:

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    private static final String CIRCUIT_BREAKER_NAME = "myCircuitBreaker";

    @CircuitBreaker(name = CIRCUIT_BREAKER_NAME, fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String hello() throws InterruptedException {
        // Simulate a failure after the circuit breaker is tripped
        Thread.sleep(1000); // Simulate a long-running operation
        return "Hello, World!";
    }

    public String fallback(Throwable t) {
        return "Fallback: Service is temporarily unavailable";
    }
}
```

In this example:

- We create a `MyService` class annotated with `@Service`.
- The `hello()` method is annotated with `@CircuitBreaker` from Resilience4j. We specify the circuit breaker's name as "myCircuitBreaker". The `fallbackMethod` attribute defines the fallback method to be called when the circuit is open.
- Inside the `hello()` method, we simulate a long-running operation (such as calling an external service) using `Thread.sleep()`.

Next, create a REST controller to expose this service:

```java
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.RestController;

@RestController
public class MyController {

    @Autowired
    private MyService myService;

    @GetMapping("/")
    public String hello() {
        try {
            return myService.hello();
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            return "Error occurred";
        }
    }
}
```

Finally, run the Spring Boot application, and it will expose the `/` endpoint, which triggers the `hello()` method in `MyService`. If the circuit is open due to a timeout, it will call the fallback method instead.

Remember to configure the circuit breaker properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. You can adjust the timeout, failure rate, and other settings according to your requirements.

To configure the adaptive circuit breaker properties in a Spring Boot application using Resilience4j, you typically need to specify the following properties in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
# Circuit Breaker Configuration
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.failure-rate-threshold=50
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.wait-duration-in-open-state=10000
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state=3
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.sliding-window-type=COUNT_BASED
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.minimum-number-of-calls=20
```

Here's what these properties mean:

- `resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.failure-rate-threshold`: The threshold (in percentage) above which the circuit breaker will trip open if the failure rate is higher. Defaults to 50 (50%).

- `resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.wait-duration-in-open-state`: The duration (in milliseconds) for which the circuit breaker will stay open before transitioning to the half-open state. Defaults to 10,000 milliseconds (10 seconds).

- `resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.permitted-number-of-calls-in-half-open-state`: The maximum number of calls permitted in the half-open state before deciding whether to keep the circuit closed or open. Defaults to 3.

- `resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.sliding-window-type`: The type of sliding window used for collecting metrics. It can be `COUNT_BASED` or `TIME_BASED`.

- `resilience4j.circuitbreaker.configs.myCircuitBreaker.minimum-number-of-calls`: The minimum number of calls needed before the circuit breaker can calculate its state. Defaults to 20.

These properties can be adjusted according to your application's requirements and performance characteristics. Remember to replace `myCircuitBreaker` with the name of your circuit breaker instance if you have configured it with a different name.
