In Java's `ExecutorService`, which is part of the `java.util.concurrent` package, you can configure different types of thread pools to execute tasks. Here are some common types of thread pools that you can create using the `Executors` utility class:

1. **FixedThreadPool**: In a fixed thread pool, the number of threads remains constant throughout the application's lifecycle. If all threads are busy executing tasks, new tasks are queued until a thread becomes available.

    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
    ```

2. **CachedThreadPool**: In a cached thread pool, the number of threads can dynamically increase or decrease based on the workload. Threads are created on demand and reused if available. If a thread remains idle for a certain period, it may be terminated and removed from the pool.

    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newCachedThreadPool();
    ```

3. **SingleThreadExecutor**: In a single-threaded executor, there is only one worker thread. Tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other, ensuring that only one task is executed at a time.

    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
    ```

4. **ScheduledThreadPool**: A scheduled thread pool is used for scheduling tasks to be executed after a specified delay or at regular intervals. It is useful for tasks that need to be executed periodically.

    ```java
    ScheduledExecutorService executor = Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(3);
    ```

5. **WorkStealingPool**: Introduced in Java 8, a work-stealing thread pool is designed for use in applications with a high degree of parallelism. It maintains multiple queues of tasks, and idle threads steal tasks from other threads' queues to keep all threads busy.

    ```java
    ExecutorService executor = Executors.newWorkStealingPool();
    ```

Each type of thread pool has its advantages and use cases. The choice of thread pool depends on factors such as the nature of tasks, expected workload, and performance requirements of the application.
