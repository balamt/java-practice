# Stream Intermediate FlatMap 

1. Similar to map method
2. Intermediate operation
3. Used in the scenario, if we have multiple streams post/after map method. (Stream of streams)

Instead of getting multiple streams (stream of streams) using map function, we use flatMap to flattern
the stream of streams.
