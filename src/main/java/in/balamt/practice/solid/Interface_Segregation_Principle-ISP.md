SOLID - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
----------------------------------------------------

The Interface Segregation Principle (ISP) is a principle of object-oriented programming that states that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. In other words, we should design interfaces that are specific to the needs of their clients, rather than creating one large interface that includes methods that may not be relevant to all clients.

In Java, we can illustrate the ISP with the following example. Let's say we have an interface called Worker that represents a worker who can do some work:

```java
public interface Worker {
    public void work();
    public void eat();
    public void sleep();
}
```

This interface includes three methods: work(), eat(), and sleep(). However, not all workers may need to eat or sleep as part of their job. For example, a programmer may only need to work and take breaks periodically, while a construction worker may need to work, take breaks, and operate heavy machinery.

According to the ISP, we should design interfaces that are specific to the needs of their clients. In this case, we can create two interfaces: Workable and Breakable:

```java
public interface Workable {
    public void work();
}

public interface Breakable {
    public void takeBreak();
}
```

Now we can create classes that implement the appropriate interfaces based on their needs. For example, a Programmer class can implement the Workable interface:

```java
public class Programmer implements Workable {
    public void work() {
    // code to do programming work
    }
}
```

And a ConstructionWorker class can implement both the Workable and Breakable interfaces:

```java
public class ConstructionWorker implements Workable, Breakable {
    public void work() {
    // code to do construction work
    }

    public void takeBreak() {
        // code to take a break
    }
}
```

By designing interfaces that are specific to the needs of their clients, we can avoid forcing clients to depend on methods they do not use. This makes our code more modular, easier to understand, and easier to maintain, which is the essence of the Interface Segregation Principle.
