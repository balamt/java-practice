SOLID
----------------------------------

**SOLID** is an acronym for five design principles that can help you create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems. These principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin in his book "Agile Software Development, Principles, Patterns, and Practices." Here are the five SOLID principles:

[**Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**](./Single_Responsibility_Principle-SRP.md) A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should only have one responsibility or job. This principle helps to keep classes small and focused, making them easier to understand and maintain.

[**Open/Closed Principle (OCP):**](./Open_Closed_Principle-OCP.md) A class should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to add new functionality to a class without modifying its source code. This principle helps to make your code more modular and easier to maintain.

[**Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):**](./Liskov_Substitution_Principle-LSP.md) Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that any instance of a subclass should be able to replace an instance of its parent class without causing any unexpected behavior. This principle helps to ensure that your code is compatible with future changes.

[**Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):**](./Interface_Segregation_Principle-ISP.md) Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. This means that you should create small, focused interfaces that are tailored to specific clients. This principle helps to prevent bloated and complex interfaces, making your code easier to understand and maintain.

[**Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):**](./Dependency_Inversion_Principle-DIP.md) Depend on abstractions, not on concretions. This means that you should depend on interfaces or abstract classes rather than concrete implementations. This principle helps to make your code more flexible and reusable, allowing you to swap out implementations without affecting the rest of your code.
